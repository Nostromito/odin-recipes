# odin-recipes

In this project I set up multiple pages of recipes and a main index page. Within each html, I set up the boilerplate from scratch, included headings, paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists. I also created image elements with alt and source attributes. Finally I added links (a) to each page from my index html.

I found this particular challenge fun because I was able to set up multiple pages, tying them all together in the end. Although it wasn't challenging, I found it ver informative. 

I am looking forward to styling these pages, making them look like a recipe page website.
