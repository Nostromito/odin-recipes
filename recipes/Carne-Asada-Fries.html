      <h3>Step 1</h3>

      <h3>Step 2</h3>
      <p>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>

      <h3>Step 4</h3>
      <p>Deep-fry the French fries in the hot oil until golden brown and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes, working in batches and adding more oil as needed. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.</p>
